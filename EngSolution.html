        <h2> What do we offer</h2>
      
        <p class="center-text"> Interact is a solution in the form of an app, which works similar to other befriend apps, but with special features designed for people who struggle with loneliness and/or depression. You can meet other people going through the same situation as you. You can choose to access forums and search for topics related to your issues or even create a topic of discussion on your own. If you are looking for a more personal approach, you can anonymously contact other people which have the same interests as you. </p>

        <p>
        With our app, can LGBT members who, for example, feel unacknowledged or do not receive support from their families, expand their social network. At the same time they can get support from others with the same sexual orientation and who go through the same situations as they do, something that may help in improving their general mental well-being.</p>

        <p> Our app would serve as a form of support for students who suffer from bullying. They may access a discussion forum about these topics, mediated by a competent person to avoid misuse and avoid heated discussions. They may also contact other people at the same age and who are experiencing the same of problems.</p>

         <p> Refugees can also find a comforting environment when using our app, by finding other people who come from the same place as them. Perhaps even meeting people from the host country who sympathize with their situation and are eager to help them.</p>

Studies show that social interaction helps keeping people mentally healthy. </p>
