                            <p>There are many people who feel lonely, especially those who have mental problems. For them, finding someone who shares their feelings, and who may be a supportive friend, is hard. Due to this, it's understandably easy to fall into a deeper depression. It isn't all that easy for a bystander to figure out what a person struggles with, merely by looking at them.</p>

                            <p>Therefore, families of, and experts on, people who have psychosocial challenges, depressions, or other psychological disorders, tell us that it is important to get to know what they really feel. For instance, one informant, of whom we interviewed, could tell us that he has two children with problems related to psychological disorders, such as depression. He explained to us that his children also need to interact with people, just like anybody else, but given their circumstance, this can be very difficult.</p>

                            <p>Furthermore, he explained that his children do use the typical social medias, Facebook, Snapchat and so on, but he clearly stated that they do not really get that much out of them.He and many other informant of whom we interviewed agreed on these medias are open to everyone, and no responsible person is governing them particularly closely. Social media can be rough enough for people currently without any psychological disorder or challenge, and using these medias can have a high toll on an insecure, vulnerable mind. 
</p>
                            <p>Another thing what was missing in the social medias according to our informants  was more entertainment directed towards people who have psychological issues, but it is quite clear nobody in this business know of their problems and needs; as though they aren't being considered or acknowledged. </p>
	
                            <p>The following chart can give an idea to what extent psychological related problem reach in to a climax stage from time to time , and for this we select only a local example from Norway in order to illustrate the problems with tangible examples.</p>
