        <p>Creating a profile is quite straight forward</p>
        <p>Our app requires the user to provide a phone number. This is to help ensure you are the correct user with added security and help you retrieve your password.</p>
        <p>Once your registration is complete, you will receive a confirmation SMS to verify it is the correct number.</p> 
        <p>Further on, you will provide the app with your personal details, interests, hobbies and what type of challenges you face. For example, if you suffer from depression, you have the option of adding this in the "Psychosocial challenges". </p>
        <p>The dropdown options may feel limited, but these are used as keywords later when searching for a person who matches your criteria. You may provide a more personal and accurate answer, which will only be visible on your profile. </p>
        <p>Finally, you select for each feature whether you want it to be visible on your profile. However, when searching based on specific crtieria, you and your match will both know what you've put on the specific options. Your profile is hidden until both parties in a conversation choose to reveal it.</p> 
      </div>

        <p>Each option is intended to grant a good number of options. Our goal is to represent a large number of people. Particularly important, we wish to allow our users to search for people to chat with based on less common criteria than other social media, like topics considered as a taboo and that will allow people to fell socially accepted. We want to allow our users to find someone to share their thoughts and feelings with, either casually or given a specific challenge they have in life.</p>

        <h2>Chatting</h2>
        <p>The app basically functions like any other message application, however, as you can see in the images below, we also provide the option to search for people based on a large arrange of criteria, like similar interests or hobbies, and including psychosocial aspects such as anxiety or depression.</p>
        <p>Your profile will remain anonymous until you decide to make it public, the same applying to the person you are chatting with. </p>
        <p> Once you decide to make your profile public, an option will appear to the person you are chatting with to make their profiles also public. Then, you have the option of adding this person to your "Friends" list.</p>

				<h2>Communities</h2>
				
				<p>Our app gives the user the possibility to open «communities” about a certain topic where people can start discussion forums and find other people who go through the same situations as they do. User also have the possibility to choose an existing community with a topic they are int</p>

				<p>Group members who participate in a forum discussion may evaluate other members by giving them “thumbs up”. No participants will know how many “thumbs up” they or the other participants have got, but after a certain time, the member with most “thumbs up” will receive the option of being the moderator for the forum. The existence of a moderator will help improve the safety and wellbeing of other users.</p>
				
				<p>There will also be an option of denouncing inappropriate behaviour, which will be evaluated by the moderator. If the moderator decides that the behaviour is against the forums rules, the one who broke the rules will get a warning message that in case they do it again, they risk being expelled from the community and, in some cases, even prohibited from accessing the app again.</p>
