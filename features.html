        <p>Creating a profile is quite straight forward. </p>
        <p>Our app requires the user to provide a phone number. This is to help ensure you are the correct user with added security and help you retrieve your password.</p>
        <p>Once your registration is complete, you will receive a confirmation SMS to verify it is the correct number.</p>

      <p>Further, you provide a number of various describing features of you. The dropdown options may feel limited, but these are used as keywords later when searching for a person who matches your criteria. You may provide a more personal and accurate answer, of which is only visible on your profile. Lastly, you select for each feature whether you want it to be visible on your profile. However, when searching based on specific crtieria, you and your match will both know what you've put on the specific options. Your profile is hidden until both parties in a conversation choose to reveal it.</p>

        <p>Each option is inteded to grant a good number of options. Our goal is to represent a large number of people. Particularly important, we wish to allow our users to search for people to chat with based on less common criteria, many of which can be difficult due to tabu and social acceptance. We want to allow our users to find someone to share their thoughts and feelings with, either casually or given a specific challenge they have in life.</p>
